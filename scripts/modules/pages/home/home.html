      This is an app that is made to practice Latin.  It is still in development but
      the main feature, the sentence generator, is operational in its basic form.
      There you can hover over a word to get any help that you may need.  Type in your
      answer in Latin in the search box and hit enter to have the correct answer show.
      If you hit enter again a new sentence will generate for you to try.

      <h3 class="col-xs-12">A few things of note</h3>

      <li>This generates random non-sense sentences for the practice of Latin</li>
      <li>There is only one sentence type at the moment, the expected order is Subject, Placement, Direct Object</li>
      <li>verbs have not been included yet</li>
      <li>long vowels should be shown with a capital letter with the exception of the i since it tends to look like a lowercase 'L'</li>
      <li>there are bugs: <ul>
        <li>plurals in the English are delt with crudely and will always show with an s
          so you will get a moneys for the plural of money</li>
        </ul></li>
